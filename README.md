# words-shuffler
I created this python script for learning Japanese. Do whatever you want with it.
# How it works
You make a python file and a text file. The text file contains all the words you want to memorize. Then the python file will read the text file, send it to the shuffling.py to shuffle the words and write the shuffled list to the terminal.
# Requirement
- python
